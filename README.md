# portfolio_basic
A simple portfolio project I have made that others are welcomed to use. This is a statically served project meaning it only involves html css and a little bit of javascript. Feel free to move around some of the icons  in the folders. 
## Header
    I wanted the header to be a simple layout. As I dont do much in terms of presentable projects, there wasnt much else to add aside from the basic applications. Perhaps it would be better to create the "Home" page as an overview bento style, but I think I would need to plan more thoroughly.
### Home/Overview
    The overview will indicate a sneak peak into the whole application. It will give a little about us: experience, projects, skills, etc... Furthermore, these sections will allow for us to move onto the other pages for a more design focused experienced. 
### Projects
    I thought about placing the about section first, however, I figured we haven't given someone who we are trying to impress a reason to learn more about us. Why should they even learn who we are and what we look like? They have things to do. Instead showcase your projects first. Make these as snappy or visually appealing as possible. Ensuring that the mobile experience is working just as much. 
### About
    This section isnt anything too crazy. Give a little information about yourself and your skills. Conversely, this could also be a resume page. An alternative idea I had for the about section was like a business card. It would be digital and fun way of expressing some information. 
### Contact 
    Obligatory Contact page that most people dont usually go to and submit to the form. Sometimes it is useful to be able to reach out or see where your work is.
#### Fin
    Please utilize this in any way or shape that is needed. However if possible please give a shoutout or favorite on Github.
